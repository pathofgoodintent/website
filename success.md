### Thanks so much for your preorder.

We have received your preorder and will ship your game to you hopefully sometime in August of 2021. You will receive an email with the shipping details once the game has been shipped out.

If you provided us with your email, you should be receiving shipping details about your purchase soon. If you do not receive anything within the hour, please [let us know](/contact) and we will help sort out the issue.

We are not a giant corporation. We are just a [one man team](/about) who is handling everything from game design to shipping. So there may be some delay in responding to your inquiries or problemsâ€”especially if it is in the middle of the night in NYC.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. And thank you for supporting indie developers and helping their dreams come true. You rock.
